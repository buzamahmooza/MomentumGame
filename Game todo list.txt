To-do list for 2D platformer:

		done:	bouncing score particles when enemies get damaged
		done:	fixing distance joint grapple
		done:	decrease attack force or increase enemy and player masses (the latter is preferred)

		done:	polish camera kickback
		done:	fix problem where the player animator controller "DashAttack" is stuck at true
		done:	grappling an enemy forces player to face enemy so he can beet the shiiiiiit 
		done:	done:	Grapple:	Make it that you have control over your movement (like Duckgame)
		done:	Use the dot product of the movementInput Vector2 â€¢ grappleTarget direction vector and let this product affect the  grapple speed
		done:	Fix controller mapping
		done:	Flipping when grappling will also flip the grabbed object if it's close enough

		
## To add:
	TODO:	Fix enemy stun
		:	make a healthbar prefab with a HealthBar script that can be dragged to the Health script, or just instantiated from the Health script (To make the healthbar reusable)
		:	Make health pickup drop when killing enemies
	done:	Add direction vector to each hitbox, and make that affect the force direction
	*make blood splatter particle effects
	*in slomo: 
		lighting goes dim
		make slomo speed lines effect
		fish-eye lens effect

## Fixing:
TODO:	make it that moving while grappling will swing the character, rather than move him in a straight line.
	Combo class and ComboInstance timer dependent on Time.timeScale
	done:	fix wall-jump

	done:	problem: shooting pickups will destroy them
	done:	patch slam glitch, sometimes when coming down the player's fall slows down
	done:	fix healthbar not going down all the way
fixed >:) heathbar slider at the start, it doesn't show the real value until it's updated








## Feedback:
3amir's feedback
	TODO:	Combo counter, every n combo you could give an ability like another double jump
	- Stunnable enemies
	- after a certain speed/ momentum, you can phase through certain objects
	- seperate aimDirection from shootDirection, make LS in charge of aimDirection and RS of shoot direction
	

	// Standing punch and air attack make the screen shake when they hit, dash attack doesn't. that's the only thing I can think of rn
			The dash attack doesn't provide enough feedback when it hits
done:	For the air attack, you could make it ignore enemy collisions on the way down so that you hit the ground instead of stopping on top of them
	and make it so that enemies hit get pushed away to either side
	
	5, done:	change input controls

Yazeed: Enemies should have blood splatter and limbs flying around when they die
		When enemies are grabbed and are close enough to the player, the player should start punching him automatically
Saeed:	Enemies should use raycasting for player detection, that way the player can hide behind objects
